# Objects in JavaScript

Recall that everything that is not primitive is an object in JavaScript.
**Objects** are used for representing complex collections of data. To the 
contrary of primitive data types, objects can store more than a "single" 
thing. Objects are central to the JavaScript language.

Objects in JavaScript are collection of key/value pairs. An object can be 
created with the use of brackets `{...}`, with an optional list of 
_properties_. A _property_ is a key/value pair with the `key: value` form, 
where `key` is a string (the property name) and `value` can be anything.

There are many kinds of objects in JavaScript. Among those, it is worth 
mentioning:

- `Array`: used to store ordered data collections
- `Date`: used to store information about date and time

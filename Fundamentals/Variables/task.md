# Variables

Like in almost any programming language, a program creates variables to store 
and process information. A _variable_ is a named storage for data that the 
program will use (create, modify, access).

In JavaScript, variables are of course named, but they are not typed by 
the programmer. Variables are declared with either the `let, const` or the 
`var` keyword.

The major difference between variables declared with `let` and `const` vs. `var`
is the scope of the variable. This difference will be explained in details 
in another task. 

When creating a new JavaScript program, you should rather use 
the `let` or `const` keyword for creating variables. When defining a 
constant variable, one should use the `const` keyword rather than `let`. 
`const` variables cannot be reassigned after they are declared.

# Dynamic data typing

JavaScript is a so-called **dynamically typed**
programming language. In such a language, variables have a
data type but are not bound to one specific type.
For example, a variable can at one moment be a number
and then a string.

For observing this, run the code and **observe** the output 
on the console. You should see `i` 
being first a `number` and then a `string`.

In the next task, you will need to tell what the type of `j` is
at the end of this program. Make sure to be ready to answer.

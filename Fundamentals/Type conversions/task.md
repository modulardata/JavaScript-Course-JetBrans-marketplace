# Type conversions 

Since JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, type conversions play an
important role and must be understood by any
JavaScript developer. Most of the time, operators and functions automatically
convert the variables given to them to the
expected type. In few cases, variables must be explicitly converted to the
expected type.

Everytime JavaScript tries to operate on a data type that is not supported for a
given operation, it will try to convert
the value to a data type that is supported. The result is not always what one
would expect. Run the example program and observe carefully the results and the
comments.

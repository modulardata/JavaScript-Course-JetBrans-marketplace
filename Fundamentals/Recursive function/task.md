# Recursive function

In JavaScript, it is of course possible to define recursive function as in 
_Java_ or other programming languages.

In this exercise, you must define a function called _isEven_ that takes a 
number as argument and check whether this argument is even based on the 
following behavior:
- `0` is even
- `1` is odd
- any negative number `n` has the same paritiy as its positive counterpart `-n`.
- any number `n` has the same parity as the number `n-2`

# Call a function repeatedly

In this exercise, you must implement the `repeat_function` function, that 
executes a function passed as argument repeatedly at a fixed interval. The 
function must use the JavaScript `setInterval` function.

The `repeat_function` returns a function that can be called for stopping the 
repeated execution, as demonstrated in the task program.

With a successful implementation, the function passed as argument must be 
called the expected number of times during a period time of time. For 
instance, with a fixed interval of `1000`ms and a period of `5000`ms, the 
function must be called `6` times (e.g. it is called immediately at time `0`)
. You may test your implementation by running the "task.js" program and then 
by checking its correct implementation using the "Check" button.

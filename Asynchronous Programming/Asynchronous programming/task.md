# Asynchronous programming

The solution to the problem illustrated in the previous task is to introduce 
**asynchronism** into your program. This can be done as illustrated in the task 
program.

This example makes use of the 'setTimeout' JavaScript function for
scheduling the execution of `taskB`. This mechanism is possible thanks to
the event loop mechanism of the JavaScript engine. The event loop will be
explained in more details in a codelab and during the lesson.

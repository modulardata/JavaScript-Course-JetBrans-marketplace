# Parsing JSON in JavaScript programs

A common use of JSON is for exchanging, storing and retrieving data. It is 
for instance very common to exchange data to/from a web server in JSON 
format (e.g. JSON being the format of the payload).

When reading from a file or receiving data from a web server, the received 
data is always a string and this data must be transformed to a JavaScript 
object in your JavaScript program. This can be easily implemented using the 
`JSON.parse()` function.

## Exercise
In the task program, you must implement the `read_users() ` function that:
 * reads the data from the file path passed as argument (in JSON format).
 * transform the JSON string data to a JavaScript object. 
 * handles faulty data properly, by catching the error and throwing it again. 

For instance, when the `read_users()` function is called with 
"users.json" as argument, it returns the correct JavaScript object. When it 
is called with "users_faulty.json" as argument, an error is generated by the 
`JSON.parse()` function. This error must be handled and the function must 
throw the error caught.

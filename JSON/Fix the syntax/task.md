# Use a JSON linter for validating a correct JSON syntax

One can validate that a given representation is using a correct JSON syntax by 
using a JSON linter such as [JSON linter](https://jsonlinter.net/). 

In the "question.json" file, we propose a JSON representation of a question 
that contains syntax errors. By using the suggested JSON linter, fix the 
syntax and check that your new representation is syntactically correct.
